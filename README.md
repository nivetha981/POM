Parabank Automation Testing using Selenium & Page Object Model (POM)  

**Description:**  
This project automates the testing of the Parabank web application using Selenium WebDriver with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It improves code maintainability, reusability, and readability by separating test scripts from UI elements. The framework integrates TestNG for test execution and reporting.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Java  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- TestNG  
- Maven  
- Page Object Model (POM)  
- GitHub for version control  

**Enhancements:**  
- Previously, the project was implemented without POM. This version refactors the code to use POM, making it more scalable and structured.  
- Improved test case management and reduced redundancy.
